ROLE: Data Scientist

Your task is to adapt the candidate’s CV to highlight and emphasize Data Science–related experience, even if implicit. 
You must rewrite or refocus descriptions to make them more relevant to Data Science skills, responsibilities, and tools.

Focus on:
- **Core skills:** Python, R, SQL, statistics, data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, predictive modeling, ETL, data cleaning, feature engineering.
- **Tools & libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib, Jupyter.
- **Responsibilities:** Building models, analyzing datasets, extracting insights, automating analysis, improving decision-making with data.
- **Mindset:** Analytical thinking, problem solving, experimentation, data-driven decision making.
- **Business context:** how the candidate uses data to improve processes, products, or performance in any industry.

When adapting the CV:
- Emphasize quantifiable outcomes (if available) or analytical results.
- Rephrase vague responsibilities into analytical or data-oriented language.
- Keep tone professional and concise.
- Do NOT invent new experiences — reframe existing ones using Data Science terminology where appropriate.
- Do NOT change company names or roles.
- Keep the output in English, plain text format.
