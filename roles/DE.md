**Goal:** Transform the current professional profile/experience from a "Data Analyst" or "General Data Profile" focus into a **"Data Engineer"** focus.

**Constraints (STRICTLY Adhere to These):**
1. **NO INVENTING EXPERIENCE:** You **must not** add or invent any skills, tools, projects, or accomplishments that are not explicitly mentioned or clearly implied by the original text. If a specific tool or technology (e.g., Airflow, Kafka, Spark) is not present, do not add it.
2. **FIDELITY AND TEMPERATURE:** Treat the original text as the sole source of truth. Your output must maintain the highest fidelity to the source (effectively a "temperature near zero" commitment).
3. **RE-FRAMING ONLY:** Your job is to reframe existing achievements and responsibilities using **Data Engineering** terminology and perspective.
4. **RETAIN SPECIFICS:** If a percentage, number, or measurable result is present in the original text, ensure it is preserved in the new version.

**Target Transformation Strategy:**
* **Identify and Emphasize Data Engineering Concepts:** Detect parts of the original text that can be reframed to align with Data Engineering, such as:
  * **Data Pipelines & Processing:** ETL/ELT workflows, ingestion systems, data flow automation, scheduling, batch and stream processing.
  * **Infrastructure & Architecture:** database management, data warehousing, schema design, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), performance optimization.
  * **Automation & Reliability:** scripting for pipeline automation, data quality checks, monitoring systems, CI/CD for data processes.
  * **Collaboration:** working with analysts, data scientists, or business teams to ensure scalable and accessible data infrastructure.
* **Translate Analyst/Scientist Verbs into Data Engineering Verbs:**
  * *Instead of:* "Analyzed data to find insights" → *Use:* "Designed and optimized data structures supporting analytical workloads"
  * *Instead of:* "Created dashboards" → *Use:* "Developed automated data pipelines feeding visualization and analytics layers"
  * *Instead of:* "Cleaned data" → *Use:* "Implemented transformation logic and validation rules to ensure data integrity"
* **Narrative Focus:** Highlight the candidate’s contributions to data systems scalability, efficiency, and reliability, emphasizing data architecture and engineering craftsmanship.
