        • SAP S/4HANA → SAP modules (FI, CO, MM, SD, PP, PM, etc.), Fiori, ABAP, or S/4HANA implementations.
        • SAP ARIBA → procurement, sourcing, supplier, contracts, catalogs, SRM, or Ariba modules.
        • ORACLE → Oracle ERP Cloud, Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS), Oracle Fusion, or tasks related to financials, procurement, supply chain, or HCM using Oracle technologies.
        • If both SAP and data skills appear, pick CONTROL TOWER only if analytics/data focus is dominant.
    - PROFILE OVERVIEW: One concise paragraph summarizing the candidate’s experience, skills, expertise, and key achievements. No names or languages. Bold **keywords**. Maximun 520 characters.
    - PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION: List university-level degrees (e.g., Bachelor’s or Master’s), separated by line breaks. Do NOT repeat information. Do NOT mention High School information. Do NOT mention Certifications.
